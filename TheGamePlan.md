Workflow

1.  create folders!

```
    /resources
        /css
            /img (different from /img in /resources)
        /js
        /data
        /img

    /vendors (this is where 3rd party files will go)
        /css (difference is for CSS that is not created by us)
        /js
        /fonts
```
